### Step 3: Write a Compelling Summary

Craft a brief summary that highlights your key skills, experiences, and what you bring to the table as a software engineer. This should be tailored for each job application to reflect the specific requirements of the position.

### Step 4: Detail Your Work Experience

List your relevant work experience in reverse chronological order. For each position, include your job title, company name, dates of employment, and bullet points detailing your responsibilities and achievements. Use action verbs and quantify your accomplishments when possible.

### Step 5: Highlight Your Education

Include your educational background, starting with your most recent degree. Mention the institution, degree earned, and any relevant coursework or projects that align with the job you're applying for.
